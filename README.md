# Bagging-and-AdaBoost-implementation-from-Scratch
Implemented Bagging and AdaBoost using Decision Tree from Scratch.
I have used Mushroom Data Set1 from the UCI Repository for this assignment. 
There are 22 attributes in this data set, of which I have dropped the attribute (stalk-root) as it contains too many missing values.
Libraries used ---Numpy,math,matplotlib
